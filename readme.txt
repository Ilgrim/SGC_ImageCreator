About
-----

This program is designed to convert 8kb, 16kb, 32kb, 49kb and 64kb ROM files into a 64kb image file to be written into
the Small Game Cartridge's EEPROM (W27C512). The program does all the necessary checks prior to conversion and it also
swaps the halves of 32kb games for compatibility with the cartridge.

The GUI is very simple. With the "Change Mode" button you can select different modes: RD, CS12, CS2 and CS1. The solder
jumper moves to the appropriate pad with every pressing of this button. Use the "Open and Convert" button to open the
desired ROM file and to convert it into the 64kb image for programming into the Small Games Cartridge.
